# CellMeter

ðŸ“¡ **CellMeter** is a drone-based platform for measuring, storing, and visualizing **cellular signal quality** and **network performance**.  
It polls a Teltonika OTD500 every second, stores telemetry locally in **InfluxDB** on the drone, and forwards it in **real time** to a ground station for Grafana dashboards and monitoring.
